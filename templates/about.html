    <h3>Why we're doing this</h3>
    <blockquote>"It is the people around us, and the most common ways we have of meeting them, of being with them, it is, in short, the ways of being which exist in our world, that make it possible for us to be alive." <small><EM>Christopher Alexander</EM> - Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.
Practicing Architect and Builder. </small>

<div class="well"><p class="text-center"><STRONG>We want all apartment and condo buildings to feel alive</STRONG></p> </div>

We all experienced this: hundreds of people live under the same roof, but everyone feels like a stranger. Residents in multifamily buildings want meaningful in-person connections with neighbors around them â€“ not social networks or messages, or small talk in an elevator. We decided to fix this problem by making it easy for people to connect on demand based on their interests and availability. <BR><BR>

<div class="well"><p class="text-center">We codified the formula that makes buildings feel alive, and we built a digital amenity to make it happen<BR><BR><STRONG>{ Ordinary Activities + Good People + Easy Way To Connect = Buildings that feel alive }</STRONG></p> </div>


    <h3>The People</h3>
